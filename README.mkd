srt.py
======

`srt.py` is a simple Python script to manipulate soft subtitles in `.srt` format. Most of the basic stuff of parsing the `.srt` format is done, so it will be relatively easy to implement high-level manipulation commands. Currently only `split` command is implemented. 

For more information about the `.srt` format, see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) and [here](http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html). 


Usage
-----

    python srt.py split subtitle.srt 42:30 45:10

This will split `subtitle.srt` into three parts, named `subtitle.srt.000`, `subtitle.srt.001`, `subtitle.srt.002`, with the `subtitle.srt.000` being 42 minutes and 30 seconds in length, `subtitle.srt.001` being 45 minutes and 10 seconds in length, and `subtitle.srt.002` the rest of the original file. 

    python srt.py shift subtitle.srt -,500 > new.subtitle.srt

This will move the subtitle 500 milliseconds towards the beginning. Output is redirected to the file named `new.subtitle.srt`. Use this to sync subtitle with video. 

    python srt.py prune subtitle.srt 1-4,34 > new.subtitle.srt

This will remove subtitles numbered 1 to 4 and 34 from the file `subtitle.srt`. Output is redirected to the file named `new.subtitle.srt`.
